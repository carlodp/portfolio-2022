    Hello! My name is Carlo and I enjoy creating things that live on the
    internet. My interest in web development started back in 2012 when I decided
    to try editing custom Tumblr themes — turns out hacking together a custom
    reblog button taught me a lot about HTML & CSS!


    Fast-forward to today, and I’ve had the privilege of working at an advertising agency, a start-up, a huge corporation, and a student-led design studio. My main focus these days is building accessible, inclusive products and digital experiences at Upstatement for a variety of clients.


    I also recently launched a course that covers everything you need to build a web app with the Spotify API using Node & React.
